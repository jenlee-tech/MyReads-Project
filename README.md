# MyReads: A Book Lending App by Jennifer Lee

## Project Overview:

In this project I cloned a respository provided by Udacity that contained a starter template. This template already contained the HTML and CSS static code. The objectives of this project was to initally have 3 shelves or sections that contains books. Each book has options to move to different shelves. These shelves are "Read," "Currently Read," "Want to Read." There is even an option for "None." The expectation of the object is to use React to provide the functionaility of these books. In addition, there is a search feature to search for more books to be placed in the shelves.
