# MyReads: A Book Lending App by Jennifer Lee

## Project Overview:

Udacity provided a repository that contained a starter template. This template already contains static HTML and CSS code. The objectives of this project were to initally have 3 shelves or sections that contain books. Each book has options to move to different shelves. These shelves are "Read," "Currently Read," "Want to Read." There is also an option for "None." The expectation of the object is to use React to provide the functionaility of these books. In addition, there is a search feature that needs to be implemented. Once a search is done, results show and the books have the option to move to different shelves.

## Installation/Launch:

- download or clone this project
- install all project dependencies with npm install
- start the development server with npm start
- a modern web browser is needed, after npm start, the browser will automatically open with this URL, http://localhost:3000/ with the default port of 3000.

## Backend Server:

For simpilicty's sake, Udacity provided a backend server to develop against. They provided a BooksAPI.js that contains methods like, getAll, update and search.

## Important:

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](https://github.com/clairehudak/Project-6-My-Reads/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md). This list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't freak out like I did, when searches such as Wonder Woman don't come back with any results.

## Further thoughts:

I felt like I went through a marathon with this project but React is definitely cool!
